A content-based movie recommendation system built using Python. It recommends similar movies based on user input using text vectorization and cosine similarity.

##  Features
- Content-based filtering using movie metadata
- Text preprocessing and feature engineering
- Cosine similarity-based recommendations
- Interactive user interface using Streamlit

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)
- Streamlit

## How It Works
The system uses movie descriptions (overview, genre, keywords, etc.) to calculate similarity between movies. Based on a selected movie, it recommends top N similar movies.
